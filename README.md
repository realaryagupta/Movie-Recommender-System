# üé¨ Movie Recommender App

A powerful movie recommendation system featuring **Content-Based Filtering**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and a **Hybrid Recommendation Engine** ‚Äî all wrapped in a sleek, interactive **Streamlit** app. Designed to provide accurate and engaging suggestions based on both user behavior and movie metadata.

## About the Project

This project explores multiple recommendation strategies to suggest movies based on user interest or selection. It goes beyond basic filtering to implement and compare:

* **Content-Based Filtering** using movie metadata (genres, keywords, overview).
* **Collaborative Filtering** via latent factor models (e.g., SVD).
* **Hybrid System** that intelligently combines both for improved recommendations.

### What I Built

* A modular recommendation pipeline supporting three industry-grade methods.
* **TF-IDF**, **cosine similarity**, and **stemmed NLP features** for content-based logic.
* **Matrix factorization with Truncated SVD** for collaborative filtering.
* Dynamic **hybrid engine** that blends scores from content and collaborative systems.
* Clean, user-friendly **Streamlit interface** for live interaction.
* **Deployed on the web** with zero-install access.

## Recommendation Approaches

### 1. Content-Based Filtering

* Uses metadata like genres, plot keywords, and summaries.
* NLP techniques: tokenization, stemming, vectorization via TF-IDF/CountVectorizer.
* Computes **cosine similarity** to find similar movies.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering

* Learns latent user preferences via **TruncatedSVD** (similar to matrix factorization).
* Suggests movies based on similarity in user rating patterns.

### 3. Hybrid Recommendation System

* Combines both systems by **weighted scoring**.
* Aims to reduce cold-start problems and improve accuracy.
